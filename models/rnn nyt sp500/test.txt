Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal and other media properties, is entertaining a $5 billion takeover offer from Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corporation.
Without the taxes being paid, Richard F. Zannino, who became the chief executive of Dow Jones in February 2006, could be eligible for more than $19.7 million in severance, retirement benefits and stock and option payouts based on the $60-a-share price offered by the News Corporation.

The Vodafone Group, the world's largest cellphone company, said on Thursday that it had received a letter from a group of shareholders asking it to return as much as Â£38 billion ($75 billion) to investors in part by spinning off its stake in Verizon Wireless.
In the latest effort by minority shareholders to influence management decisions, a little-known group of investors, Efficient Capital Structures, suggested that Vodafone give its investors tracking shares representing the company's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, the American cellular carrier; increase borrowing as a way to return more money to shareholders; and ask the permission of shareholders before making any large acquisitions.
An analyst at Goldman Sachs in London, Simon Weeden, said that he did not expect the claims to be taken seriously and that a spinoff of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless would create complex tax issues and would dilute shareholder rights.

The Wii and Sony's technology-packed PlayStation 3 went on sale in the United States in November, a year after Microsoft rolled out its Xbox 360.
With its new approach, Nintendo hopes to avoid the disappointments of its previous home game console, GameCube, which placed a distant third in the United States against Sony's PlayStation 2 and the Xbox of Microsoft, say analysts and game developers.
''The relationship is warmer and more active than before,'' said Jeff Brown, the spokesman for Electronic Arts, the giant game developer based in Redwood City, Calif.
Nintendo plans to dominate newest generation of video game consoles by working with software developers more closely than in past; strategy has helped sell 2.5 million Wii gaming consoles in United States, almost double Sony's PlayStation 3; Microsoft's 360 has sold 5.4 million units; larger number of game titles is key to Wii's success; photos (M)
These days advertisers fret over DVR owners fast-forwarding through their commercials, but that was far from the case with the release by Apple last week of four iPhone commercials, which viewers pored over with Talmudic intensity.
Last week, three new television commercials for the iPhone divulged the product's release date -- June 29 -- and showed off a range of features that led Apple fans to seek more details.
In a typical post, Erica Sadun on the Unofficial Apple Weblog (www.tuaw.com) extrapolated how the device's e-mail and map search functions might work, based on the mere seconds that each function was shown in the commercials.
What was this ''mystery'' application, he wondered, and then said four days later that the 12-icon shot had been edited out of the same commercial featured on apple.com.
Many bloggers also wrote that fine print initially appearing in ads -- which said that iPhone purchasers would be locked into a "minimum new two-year activation plan" with AT&T  -- was absent from similar ads posted on apple.com, leading, of course, to speculation whether iPhone buyers would have to sign such a contract.
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on an AT&T plan or any other aspect of the iPhone or its commercials.
It is typical for Apple to remain silent, even if speaking up would quash rumors, said Tim Beyers, who wrote about the iPhone ads for the Motley Fool (fool.com).
''When Apple does nothing to stop rumors from circulating, the feeding frenzy gets more and more intense,'' Mr. Beyers said.
The nature of Apple is that by virtue of the fact that they talk sparingly, they get talked about -- they create this almost audible buzz.''
After Apple's initial announcement in January, ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' broadcast a fake iPhone commercial in which the device was used in myriad ways, including as a bottle opener, electric shaver, blow-dryer and condiment dispenser.
''If you look closely, though, there's a wealth of other good music that the iPhone is playing,'' said Mr. Johnston, who praised Apple for featuring indie-rock darlings like Feist and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah over mainstream chart-toppers.
''I'm a huge Apple geek,'' he said in an interview.
Apple's ad agency got the restaurant's permission beforehand.
''And I say, 'We're a restaurant, not an Apple Store.'
A Few Details of the iPhone Galvanize the Apple Cadre
''They are creating tests that a reasonably healthy adult can't pass,'' said Gordon Weakliem, a programmer and blogger from Denver, who says he failed to correctly discern the captcha code several times last week on the sign-up page for the Windows Live service of Microsoft.
With captchas getting easier for computers and more difficult for real people, several Internet companies, including Microsoft and eBay, are working on replacements.
''You can make a captcha absolutely undefeatable by computers, but at some point, you are turning this from a human reading test into an intelligence test and an acuity test,'' said Michael Barrett, the chief information security officer at PayPal, a division of eBay.
Microsoft researchers have developed an alternative captcha that asks Internet users to view nine images of household pets and then select just the cats or the dogs.
''For software, this is wildly hard,'' said John Douceur, a Microsoft researcher.
In March, the CSTV Networks division of the CBS Corporation -- the ''CS'' stands for college sports -- acquired MaxPreps, which operates a Web site (maxpreps.com) and has more than a million high school athletes in its database.
Another media giant, the Time Inc. division of Time Warner, formed an alliance in December with Takkle, which operates a social-networking Web site for high school athletes (takkle.com).
The outsize robot adventure movie was born when the talent agency connected Hasbro -- a client, and owner of the Transformers toy line -- with DreamWorks, Paramount and another longtime associate, Steven Spielberg, among others.
As the project grew, at least 10 Creative Artists clients picked up credits, including the writers, several stars and both Mr. Spielberg and Brian Goldner, Hasbro's chief operating officer, who are executive producers.
But a scant month before the picture's release on July 4, Hasbro decided to jettison Creative Artists and jump to the rival William Morris, which represents the director of ''Transformers,'' Michael Bay.
Wayne Charness, Hasbro's senior vice president for corporate communications, credited Creative Artists for its ''invaluable assistance'' in hooking it up with DreamWorks and Paramount.
For Creative Artists, the loss of Hasbro is hardly a show-stopper.
In that time, it not only raided competitors for agents and talent in the movie and television businesses, but began representing athletes and added dozens of marketers and licensing operatives who are supposed to keep pace with the likes of Coca-Cola, Delta, eBay and, until lately, Hasbro.
Yet the contretemps with Hasbro points to some vulnerabilities that come with being the mightiest talent agency in Hollywood, not the least of them the difficulty of minding what has become a very large store.
According to Mr. Charness of Hasbro, the company initially came to Creative Artists for help in connecting its games and toys with a wide range of promotions.
Mr. Bay's agents at William Morris, meanwhile, detected Hasbro's hunger for more movies.
In short, Hasbro wanted to go Hollywood.
The ups and downs of the company's famous PlayStation division are well known, as it struggles to maintain its dominance in home consoles over Microsoft and Nintendo.
General Electric's NBC unit and Microsoft explored making a joint bid for Dow Jones but decided against it a week ago, a person close to NBC and Microsoft said yesterday.
Microsoft and NBC were partners in forming the MSNBC cable television network.
Representatives from NBC and Microsoft talked to advisers to the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones.
But after the preliminary discussions and a more detailed analysis by NBC and Microsoft executives, they decided against going further.
NBC then contacted Microsoft about the possibility of a joint move.
But following a brief review, Microsoft rejected the idea of taking further steps, and NBC agreed, the person said.

''People really shouldn't be too concerned about the airplane having difficulty in turbulence -- it's designed for turbulence,'' said Jeff Bland, senior manager for commercial airplane loads and dynamics at Boeing, adding that structural failures because of turbulence are rare.
In fact, a video clip  available on YouTube shows Boeing's test of the wing of a 777; using cables, the wing is bent upward about 24 feet at the tip before it breaks.
And Boeing's 787 aircraft will have a new vertical gust suppression system to minimize the stomach-churning sensation of the plane suddenly dropping midair.
Apple said Monday that it would make its Safari Web browser available for Windows-based PCs, opening a new front in its rivalry with Microsoft.
The announcement came at the end of a presentation made by Steven P. Jobs, Apple's co-founder and chief executive, at the company's annual World Wide Developers Conference.
It indicates that Apple is increasingly confident in its ability to compete against Microsoft's desktop computing monopoly.
Shares of Apple dropped sharply after the announcement, falling $4.30, to $120.19.
In recent years, Apple's chief executive has refined product announcements into an art form that leaves his audience cheering and then rushing to a store.
With his usual showmanship, Mr. Jobs said that Safari would have twice the performance capability of Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer.
He also expressed confidence that Apple would be able to increase its market share against the dominant software company, pointing to half a billion downloads of Apple's iTunes software, most of them by Windows users.
A test version of the program was available Monday for downloading  from Apple's Web site.
In an interview after his presentation, Mr. Jobs said he had no concerns that the new competition might anger Microsoft or lead to retaliation, such as slowing the development of the version of Office for the Macintosh.
Like many of Apple's strategic moves, the implication of an Apple browser for Windows was not immediately clear.
It is likely that Mr. Jobs is now plotting a broader business strategy that will allow Apple to grow beyond its niche position in the computer market of about a 5 percent share.
Apple's move is significant, industry executives said, because it indicates that despite the end of the browser wars of the late 1990s, Microsoft's continued ability to retain more than 80 percent market share is a continuing threat to its competitors.
There has been a persistent fear that Microsoft would be able to create new standards that would force computer users to adopt its software to reach certain Web sites and Internet services.
The broader appeal of the browser might have implications for Apple's iPhone.
In his presentation, Mr. Jobs said that the company was encouraging Apple software developers to use modern Internet software standards to make applications compatible with Apple's iPhone, which will go on sale June 29.
By moving software development away from personal computers and cellular phones and toward the Internet, Apple is attempting to persuade its developers that they can achieve new economies of scale while permitting the computer and consumer electronics firm to build more secure devices and computers.
''There is something very clever going on here with Apple releasing Safari for Windows,'' said Scott Love, president of Aquaminds Software, a Macintosh developer based in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Don't ever underestimate S.
Some developers said they were disappointed that Apple would continue to restrict software development for the iPhone.
Mr. Jobs had shown many of the features, such as a new backup system called Time Machine and a new more powerful version of the Apple instant messaging system called iChat.
At previous events announcing the Leopard version of Apple's Mac OS X operating system, Mr. Jobs has hinted at important new features.
The reference was a not-so-subtle jab at Microsoft, which offers Windows Vista at a variety of price points with different features.
Apple, of course, will sell just one version.

Apple, Challenging Its Archrival, Is to Release a Windows Browser
The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb pleaded guilty on Monday to making false statements to a federal agency, ending an unusual criminal case involving its blockbuster blood-thinning drug Plavix.
But Qwest was ultimately outbid by a rival, Verizon Communications.
In one PowerPoint presentation from 2000, a Bristol-Myers Squibb executive told employees that oncologists' biggest concern was ''Reimbursement Today, Reimbursement Tomorrow, Reimbursement!''
In that trial, the defendants were AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Johnson & Johnson and Schering-Plough -- four of the world's 20 largest drug companies.
Medicare's decision to reform way it paid for cancer drugs came after decade in which oncologists collectively made billions of dollars on drugs they prescribed; many doctors say those profits did not affect their prescribing patterns; industry documents that have emerged in federal civil lawsuit in Boston show that big pharmaceutical companies sometimes calculated to penny profits that doctors could make from their drugs; sales representatives shared those profit estimates with doctors and their staffs; documents were gathered for lawsuit that is before Federal Judge Patti B Saris; defendants in that trial were AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson and Schering-Plough (M)

When Terry S. Semel, Yahoo's chief executive, faces shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Tuesday, Eric Jackson will be there to pepper him with questions.
Mr. Jackson, who owns just a few Yahoo shares, is not happy with the company's performance, so he has mounted a grass-roots campaign calling for changes including the removal of Mr. Semel and several company directors.
Then there are the members of Yahoo's own management ranks -- some of whom have not waited around for answers.
The head of Yahoo's technology group, Farzad Nazem, left late last month after 11 years with the company.
And Yahoo has yet to name an executive to run the audience group, which was created in December and oversees many of the Yahoo's most important Web offerings.
In addition, 17 executives at the vice president level or higher are known to have left Yahoo since the December shake-up.
But the defections include executives who were widely praised, ran important businesses within Yahoo and left for places that seemed to offer better opportunities.
Yahoo disputes the notion that it is losing people at an unusual rate, saying that it had named about 80 vice presidents worldwide this year, most of them promoted from inside.
''It's a buyer's market in terms of hiring people out of Yahoo,'' said a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist who asked to remain anonymous, in part because three of the companies he has backed are talking to different Yahoo vice presidents about possible jobs.
The departed executives include one of Mr. Nazem's top deputies in engineering, the senior vice president in charge of HotJobs, two executives who ran Yahoo's music business, the head of the health and food Web sites, the heads of international and European operations and an important search executive.
