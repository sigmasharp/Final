    "\n",
    "Facing various challenges on financial news article sentiment analysis, this project proposed and explored several RNN/LSTM based models. Since the main dataset, New York Times Annotated Corpus (LDC2008T19) lasks polarity annotation, a dated stock trend has been tested as an indirect indicator of the running sentiment of the involved articles/sentences.  With 130K sentences with a SP500 mentioning and tagged with corresponding stock trends, an RNN/LSTM model with each word predicting the trend.  Then the trend is mixed with vader lexicon in the second model.  Finally, an approach of applying categorized LMs that share the common vocabulary is proposed as an alternative method to perform sentiment or other classification analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center>Goals</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "My interested in financial new article sentiment analysis was actually originally for automatically reading, analyzing, archiving financial articles and cross-referencing it to the actual market performance to hold Financial Analysts responsible of their market predictions.  As W266 studying and scheduling panning out, the focus of this project has been practically evolved into achieving sentiment analysis exploration goal with respect to the following logistical oriented objects:\n",

    "1.\tStaying with [NYT](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19).\n",
    "2.\tStaying with RNN/LSTM, (i.e. Assignment 1, Part 2).\n",
    "3.\tStarting with SP500 trend (stock price delta) as sentiment indicator\n",

    "## <center>Dataset Cleansing and Preprocessing</center>\n",

    "### Highlights of the New York Times Annotated Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "- 01/01/1987 to 06/18/2007 (over 20 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1.8M overall articles in xml format by yy/mm/dd\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1.5M articles manually tagged w/ organizations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 275K of it algorithmically-tagged and hand verified\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocument of this corpus LDC2008T19 is attached [here](reference/new_york_times_annotated_corpus.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleansing and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig 1](./data processing.png) \n",
    "This figure gives a high-level account of the data cleansing and preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the existing annotation of 'org' (organization) in NYT corpus which lists all organization mentioned in the articles, and with SP 500 company names, the 1.8M artciles are extracted into 400K articles then into 130K sentences with a mentioning of one of the SP500 compaies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the daily stock price of the SP500 companies over these 20 years (kibot.com), the polority of the sentiment of each sentence is defined to be 'pos' or 'neg' if the weekly average price of the company mentioned is higher or lower respectively than the week before, with respect to the publication date.  (Please note: it is possible that a sentence mentioned two companies, in which case, the same sentence will enter the system twice, each time with a potentially different polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At one point the polarity was measured by weekly return (a ratio between 0.5 to -0.5) which can be broken down into 15 or 7 levels.  This approach was given up for short of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center>Background & Challenges</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been many approaches to deal with the fianancial article sentiment analysis, which is noticeably different from the general opion driven projects like movie and yelp reviews, or twitters.  One major problem starts with the lexicon variance.  Below is a contrast of how our collection, with ran through nltk.vader analyzer, end up with over 95% neutural predictions (above 70% probability) by vader.\n",
    "\n",
    "![nltk.vader to NYT articles](./vader.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:  Report convention\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried three approaches and, though all implementations are RNN/LSTM (Assignment 1/Part 2) based, I tried to separate them into different code bases. This is not only because they differ in various details, but also due to the dynamic implementation focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since all applied models share the same codebase, I will make high-level description here in the main report and provide links to individual ipython notebooks for comments on various implementation detail, including test results.  Also, I'd add 'future work' note within each model so the Conculsion is 'purely' conclusion. :)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <center>Model 1 - Word level Sentiments Predicting RNN/LSTM</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model is simply reapplying the LM RNN/LSTM to have each work from a sentence to predict, instead of the next word, the associated polarity, ('pos' or 'neg').  \n",
    "\n",
    "![layers](RNNLM - layers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the fact that sentimental analysis might not itutively be the best fit for this model, the adaptation from LM to predict sentiment looks simple on the plot.  However, a few detail needs to be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The biggest structural delta is the output layer size, which 'shrinks' from V (= 10000) to Z (=3 for 'pos', 'neg' and 'neu').\n",
    "- The LM does not explicitly provide the target (which is always the next word in the seq). However, for sentiment prediction, we need to do preprocessing and align the y.  \n",
    "- The nltk should have more tools to tag the source more elegantly, but I managed to make the system work according to the plan.\n",
    "- After the training, I had some concerning on scoring the sampling. I may want to come up with a differnt loss (on averaging or voting out) on all words in the same sentence in the future.\n",
    "- I realized that for this model, it may not be sufficient to just have train-test partition.  I introduced a dev set and I need to keep it until the training to measure the system 'objectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "## <center>Model 3 - Categoried LMs for NLP Classification</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center>Conclusions</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single word level RNN/LSTM may not be the best tool to handle sentiment analysis or other classification tasks because of the relatively long and scattered backprop rhythms.  By forcing each work to predict the class can help, but it may put too much weight on the last word, which is the main predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using stock trend as and indicator for sentiment may be a long shot mainly because the association in real life is not obvious.  Especially in the context of multiple-mentionings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, I am very interested on exploring more on the categorized multiple LMs as a classifier model.  Though I agree and understand the effectiveness for classification learning is questionable, I like the implication of the variance between the one sub-LM versus another sub-LM versus the union-LM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For lack of another timely channel, I would like to conculde this project by offering my gratefulness to both instructors for your willingness and ethuthism to help and your profound knowledge of the subject. \n",
